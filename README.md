## About me

Hello, I'm Andr√©s. Currently, I'm coursing a specialized program in data analysis and artificial intelligence at Impelia Professional Campus.Throughout my months of learning, I've been gaining proficiency in various tools such as Python, SQL, and machine learning. In my free time, I often create basic programs to reinforce the knowledge I've acquired. I also engage in exploring new topics of interest with the goal of expanding my understanding in all the branches I've studied. Looking ahead, I aspire to apply my programming skills to marketing campaigns for data collection. This fusion of programming and marketing aligns with my vision for leveraging technology to enhance and optimize future initiatives.
