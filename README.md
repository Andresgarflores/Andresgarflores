### About me
With a dedicated focus on learning, I've been immersed in acquiring skills in data analysis, SQL, and machine learning, predominantly using the Python environment. My understanding in these disciplines is solid, though still progressing towards an advanced level. In addition to my learning journey, I hold a background in marketing and aspire to merge my marketing expertise with Python knowledge. I aim to apply these skills, particularly in optimizing campaigns and achieving stellar results in the dynamic realm of marketing.
